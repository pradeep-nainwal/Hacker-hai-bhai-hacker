# Hacker Typer Simulation

This project simulates a hacker typing experience, allowing users to mimic coding activities with dynamic progress indicators, video animations, and simulated coding effects.

## Features
- **Typing Simulation**: As the user types, code appears on the screen to simulate coding.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar shows the completion of the typing simulation.
- **Video Animation**: After the progress bar completes, a hacking video plays.
- **Mission Complete Screen**: Displays a mission completion message after the video ends.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Pages
1. **Intro Page** (`index.html`): Provides instructions and an option to start the simulation.
2. **Main Simulation Page** (`main.html`): The primary interactive typing simulation page.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` to read the instructions.
2. Click on the "Start HackerTyping..." button to begin the simulation.
3. Start typing on the keyboard to display code and fill the progress bar.
4. After completion, a video will play followed by the "Mission Complete" screen.
5. Use the "Return to Home Page" button to navigate back to the intro page.

## Instructions
- **Start Typing**: Begin typing on the keyboard to simulate coding.
- **Special Key Functions**:
  - Press `ALT` three times to display "Access Granted".
  - Press `CAPS LOCK` three times to display "Access Denied".
  - Press `ESC` to clear messages.

## Customization
- **Video and Audio**: Replace `hack1.mp4` and `hacker-hai.mp3` with your own media files.
- **Code Content**: Modify the `codeLines` variable in `main.html` to change the displayed code.
- **Styling**: Adjust CSS styles in the `<style>` tags within each HTML file for custom designs.
